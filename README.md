# **Dragon Ball game**

## **Introduction**

The game pretends to be a classic fighting game from the Dragon Ball Z series. The object is to defeat the opponent.

The game is quite simple and is mainly divided into a javascript document for each character and another more general actions.js file where the modal that appears when finishing the game is located.


## **Difficulties**
Among the main complications was finding the necessary images and gifs. So I had to create them myself.


## **Development Specs**
Developed in vanilla Javascript and Css.
